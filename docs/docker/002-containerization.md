# Containerization in Depth

Containerization is a deployment method where you package your application with all its dependencies into a standalone unit called container, inside the container your application code, the dependencies required by the application, and the project configuration files will exists and work with each other without any problems.

Each container runs on it's own isolated space, preventing conflicts between applications and ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying system. Containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs) that have their own full OS, this approach improves resource efficiency.

## Containerization vs. Virtualization

Both containerization and virtualization are methods for isolating applications, but they differ in their approach:

- Virtualization / Creates a virtual machine (VM) with a complete guest operating system, offering a higher level of isolation but consuming more resources.
- Containerization / Packages an application with its dependencies, sharing the host kernel and offering greater resource efficiency and faster deployment.

## Practical Example

Traditionally, deploying an application could involve:

- Setting up the Server
- Managing Dependencies
- Configuration Hassles

Here's how containerization streamlines this process:

- Container Image Creation
- Deployment
- Running on the Server
