# Base

This is my personal knowledge base. Here, you'll find everything from templates and configurations to documents for various tools, technologies, and more. The base contains notes, cheat sheets, code snippets, configurations, project structures, and best practices that I use when working with various tools and programming languages.

## Work in Progress!

There are still more things to add to this repository and it is not fully completed.

## Note

All the resources in this repository are from old notes I've taken while learning programming throughout the years. I decided to combine them all in one repository.
